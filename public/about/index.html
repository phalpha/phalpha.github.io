  </summary>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>In January 2020, during my first year at Stanford University, I took an elective class called &ldquo;Heartfulness, Mindfulness, Compassion, and Responsibility.&rdquo; The homework before the first class was to answer the following question: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote then:</p>
<p>&quot; I am a brother to one, a son to two, a cousin to ten, a friend to many, and a student of the world. I am from hectic yet melancholy Central Jersey suburbs with neighborhood movie days, block parties, and sports activities, but I am also from the tropical Western Ghats in in southwest India amidst hills, forests, and villages. I am a thinker, discoverer, and explorer. I am not artistically talented but I love to doodle; I am not musically talented but I love to hum and sing. I am at times silent and radiate peace, like a gentle fawn, yet at other times I am as loud and full of chaos, like fireworks in the sky. I am a social and political subject of this world. I am desperately searching for solutions and explanations for all the suffering that surrounds and overwhelms me. I am happy but I am also a little sad. I am an eager learner and an enthusiastic teacher. I am stumbling because of the burdens on my back, the pain in my heart, and the exhaustion in my muscles, which threaten to make me fall at any moment. I am who I am because of those who have inspired me - my family, my friends, my teachers, and everyone else, across time, space, species, and existence. I am stubborn and I am unsatisfied. I am afraid but I am brave. I am imperfect but I am improving. I am Poojit Hegde.&quot;</p>
<p>rom my 2020 response to where I am now, I think there are many continuities in my consciousness, but there have also been certain ruptures. One thing I said then was that &ldquo;I am not artistically talented&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am not musically talented&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think I would say that about myself now - I will call myself an aspiring artist and musician, and through continuously acting upon my aspirations by making art and music, I too am an artist and musician already. In fact, even when I did initially write that, I wasn&rsquo;t a stranger to art and music. I think the reason I explicitly identified myself as someone who wasn&rsquo;t good at art or music was to avoid setting expectations of being a &ldquo;great musician&rdquo; or a &ldquo;great artist&rdquo;. That reflected my own insecurity in my relative lack of experience in certain musical and artistic endeavors. I think this fear of being perceived as talented largely emerges from the kind of society we live in - which is so unnecessarily competitive, and always looking to pit people against one another and measure people&rsquo;s &ldquo;talents&rdquo; relatively. I won&rsquo;t say I have overcome this fear completely, but I am trying to overcome this sense of self-doubt. This also means to not doubt the creative capabilites of those around me either. I don&rsquo;t want to evaluate those around me based on narrow visions of talent or success.</p>
<p>Okay, I am an artist and a musician of sorts - what else? I also would like to call myself an aspiring scientist and engineer. My love for science is driven by a commitment to deepen our collective understanding of how the universe works. For me, science is more than theoretical analysis—it’s a dialectic between theory and practice, grounded in our material reality. Engineering, in turn, is the practical application of that scientific inquiry: engineers not only seek to understand the world but actively intervene in it, shaping both experiments and social production. Participating in human and material production is fundamentally human, and so to be an engineer is to embrace our humanity. Even when I focus intensely on a specific area of research, I approach each problem with an engineer’s mindset, continually linking my work back to its social implications and to what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Another difference from my response in 2020 I would identify now is that I am not stumbling so much anymore! I have made it through the abyss and out, and I am not so fearful. The prospect of falling does not feel so overwhelming, and I am moving with greater confidence in myself and sharper clarity regarding the world around me. In essence, I feel far more curious than afraid. I also would evaluate myself as more balanced. While my heart still feels continuously bright and alive, it is not always on fire. And while my spirit still soars through the sky, the ground underneath my palms and feet feels comfortable as well. I am still searching for solutions and explanations - I have found some, but other questions continue to open up, as I keep experiencing more dynamics of this society and universe. It is a joy of life to continuously create, discover, and explore anew, and I find this mindset to bring me so much intrinsic motivation in my various scientific, artistic, engineering pursuits.</p>
<p>The last line is the one I am now trying to hold onto most closely - &ldquo;I am imperfect but I am improving&rdquo;. Just like societal development, personal growth rarely follows a monotonically increasing trajectory. Through intentionally developing my life practices and thoroughly reflecting on how my life practices are going, I hope to continue learning and growing into the future, no matter what is in front me.</p>

    <p>I just graduated from college, and I am currently looking for full time employment.</p>
<p>Ultimately I love the act of creating and discovering new things, especially in collaboration with others. I have experience with various kinds of technologies, but I really believe that it is the people working on the technology that make the difference, not just the technology by itself. In that sense, I take very seriously my personal commitments to doing good work with the skills and time I have.</p>
<p>On that note, I am working on several technical projects concurrently as I am applying for jobs, including building a tool for improving difficult-to-read PDFs with AI, designing a household energy estimation predictor with a friend, and even putting together this website! Check out some of these projects as well as other previous projects on my &ldquo;Projects&rdquo; page in this website.</p>
<p>I also spend time every week on educational projects, specifically leading two summer studies for Stanford undergraduate students on topics in politics, society, and history. I also am a tutor in math, science, and even chess. If you or someone you know is looking for a tutor or mentor, please let me know! I especially am eager to devote any extra time I have to supporting students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
