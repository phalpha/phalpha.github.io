## Research Focus

The project explored the research question: **Which genes are expressed in *Landoltia punctata*, and how do they compare with expressed genes from other species?**

*Landoltia punctata* (duckweed) is a freshwater aquatic plant of significant scientific interest due to its applications in:
- Bioremediation 
- Potential biofuel production

## Methodology

- Isolated and sequenced genes from a cDNA library (mRNA sequences copied into DNA)
- Analyzed previously undetermined sequences from *Landoltia punctata*
- Performed comparative sequence analysis with other eukaryotic organisms
- Investigated evolutionary relationships through phylogenetic analysis

## Research Outcomes

Successfully analyzed and submitted two novel DNA sequences to the NCBI GenBank, the international repository of DNA sequences:

- **GenBank Accession: 94PH1.15 WSSP Duckweed cDNA library Landoltia punctata cDNA similar to glutathione peroxidase 6, mRNA sequence** - [NCBI Entry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JZ971611.1)
- **94PH1.16 WSSP Duckweed cDNA library Landoltia punctata cDNA similar to Rhodanese-like domain-containing protein, mRNA sequence** - [NCBI Entry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JZ971610.1)

These sequences are now permanently archived in the public database and available for use by the global scientific community.
