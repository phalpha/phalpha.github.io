summary: "License Plate detection with a microcontroller"

Okay this was a project my friend and I worked on for a year (2018 in high school), and I really learned a lot from it (how to connect machine learning software to microcontrollers like the Jetson TK1, for example), but somehow we both are unable to locate our source code, videos for demo, or our documentation! The excuse we have is because we both placed it on our school emails from high school which we no longer have access to, but I have a feeling I can locate this somewhere else. Keeping this project page up because this was a project I was proud of, so hopefully I will have a more clear write-up soon!
