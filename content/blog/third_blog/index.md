Here are a few poems inspired by mathematics that I have written in recent times. Thought I would share!

## A Smudge that fills the world!

*I wrote this after taking a class on theoretical linear algebra, a year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A reflection of the dynamics of an epidemic, with some mathematical imagery.*


>I write with a pen <br>
A fountain pen, royal blue in color <br>
with the edges the color of ore <br>
My hand slips <br>
The ink drips <br>
There’s a smudge! <br> <br>
It’s small, not to noticeable. <br>
Not a big deal. <br>
Or is it? <br> <br>
This is a special kind of paper. <br>
A linear algebra paper. <br>
And the smudge? <br>
It just happened to be big enough <br>
Big enough to be the dominant eigenvalue. <br> <br>
The spectral radius. <br> <br>
Now the generations pass <br>
The rates adjust <br>
What once seemed small is growing. <br> <br>
The smudge, that miniscule smudge, that bothersome smudge <br>
that once was a tiny drop on the paper <br>
Now fills the world. <br> <br><br>
**November 17th, 2019: the first known case of COVID-19 is detected. <br>
Today, November 17, 2020: 55.6 million cases, 1.34 million deaths, 1 world - our world will never be the same.**

## Magic of Monte Carlo

*I wrote this after taking a class on algorithms. For my final project, I wrote a paper about monte carlo methods. This is a small poem considering the relationship between the place, Monte Carlo in in Tuscany known for its casinos, and the concept, Monte Carlo, referring to simulations, chance. Bit of a gamble.*

 
>At last we arrived, frazzled yet curious<br>
Just a few skips inland of the mighty Mare Nostrum<br>
A rag covering most of my eyes<br>
But somehow I see more clearly than ever <br><br>
The early afternoon mist is carried by a gradual breeze<br>
Echoing with muffled murmurs of a not-so-distant past<br>
The air grows heavy, burdened with yesterday’s memories<br>
A carob tree rustles, prematurely pruned of its possibilities<br>
Finally, when afternoon turns to dusk<br><br>
The stumbling breeze turns to a fiery gust<br>
Mist turns into mud, inside out and upside down<br>
The hollowness of it all becomes inescapable<br>
It didn’t take me long to realize that I was far from home
